// The package.json file is an important part of any Javascript project since it contains metadata pertaining
// to our current project. We use npm init to create a package.json file, and when we install additional packages
// we can use npm install <packagename> --save to add that package as a dependency in our package.json file

// From here on out, we will have a package.json file standard in all of our projects.
